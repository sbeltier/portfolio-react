# Portfolio (React.js)

# Description
This portfolio is the React.js version of what I've accomplished throughout UCSD's Coding Bootcamp. Built on React, this portfolio is a single page application, which enables flexibility and a more efficient development workflow.

# Usage
The top navigation bar allows for quick usage of the page. After clicking an image, the project name, a screenshot, a description, and links to the live site and repo are presented to the user in a modal.

# Future Development
The form is currently not connected to a database. There is also room for improvement and innovation on the design.
